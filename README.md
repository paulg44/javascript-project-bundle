# javascript-project-bundle

A vanilla JavaScript project, all your favourites, from basic games to to-do lists!

I have, for some time, been concentrating more on frameworks (React, Ruby, Typescript) and CSS frameworks (Bootstrap) and I would like to go back a little bit and create a project purely in vanilla JavaScript and CSS. It will consist of all the basic applications people build, maybe with a twist on a few of them, I will try to add APIâ€™s where possible. Basically this will be one project with a bunch of applications in it.

## Rock, Paper, Scissors

Well, this was far more difficult than I anticipated. It just shows if you don't keep on top of everything and don't code a specific way for a while it's so easy to forget basic functions. However I've managed to get the game functioning as I'd expect it to, with a little help form past projects I'm not ashamed to admit.
