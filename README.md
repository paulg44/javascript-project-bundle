A vanilla JavaScript and CSS project, all your favourites, from basic games to to-do lists!

I have, for some time, been concentrating more on frameworks (React, Ruby, Typescript) and CSS frameworks (Bootstrap) and I would like to go back a little bit and create a project purely in vanilla JavaScript and CSS. It will consist of all the basic applications people build, maybe with a twist on a few of them, I will try to add APIâ€™s where possible. Basically this will be one project with a bunch of applications in it. I will also try to show mmy design and vanilla CSS skills with some (hopefully) different and fun versions of all these beginner favourites.

## Rock, Paper, Scissors

Well, this was far more difficult than I anticipated. It just shows if you don't keep on top of everything and don't code a specific way for a while it's so easy to forget basic functions. However I've managed to get the game functioning as I'd expect it to, with a little help form past projects I'm not ashamed to admit. I've added the score logic so the score now keeps up, I have also added a restart game button that displays upon starting the game.

# Takeaways

Javascript - I learned (again) about scopes within function, sometimes you cannot access the things you want as they are function scoped or globally. Also refreshed my memory about textContent, create and amending elements.
CSS - So this has turned into a full on project like I knew it would, just can't help myself. I've very much enjoyed it, a lot of the CSS is n the JavaScript file as I've had to create elements for the jump scares and it's also been a great reminder of how to add audio into projects as I'd not done that for quite a while. I think I ended up focusing mainly on the UI/UX of this game, where the jump scares would happen for example. I really enjoyed this and wold like to do more in the future.

## Drumkit

A pretty easy and straightforward project using eventListeners and audio files. Simple as click a button of desired drum sound and said sound plays

# Takeaways

This was quite a simple process, it cemented my knowledge of using audio files but the main takeaway was using the forEach method to use on the eventListeners instead of writing each one out individually. I am still getting my head around exactly how this function works, as I had somme help. But it makes so much sense to write far less code. I believe this will come in handy again when I do the calculator app.

## Quiz App

I definitely had some issues with this project. Getting the API running and working was all fine getting one question and the corresponding answers was fairly easy, however. I decided to have each question on its own separate page and thats when I ran into issues. Mainly having the question and answers corresponding correctly. It still has a few bugs to iron out and don't judge me on the UI/UX or CSS on this one. It was a lot of JavaScript so I kept the design to a minimum.
